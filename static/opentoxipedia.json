In the assessment and evaluation of toxic characteristics of substances, determination of acute oral toxicity in honeybees may be required, e.g. when exposure of bees to a given chemical is likely. The acute oral toxicity test is carried out to determine the inherent toxicity of pesticides and other chemicals to bees. The results of this test should be used to define the need for further evaluation. In particular, this method can be used in stepwise programmes for evaluating the hazards of pesticides to bees, based on sequential progression from laboratory toxicity tests to semi-field and field experiments. Pesticides can be tested as active substances or as formulated products. A toxic standard should be used to verify the sensitivity of the bees and the precision of the test procedure.Adult worker honeybees (Apis mellifera) are exposed to a range of doses of the test substance dispersed in sucrose solution. The bees are then fed the same diet, free of the test substance. Mortality is recorded daily during at least 48 h and compared with control values. If the mortality rate is increasing between 24 h and 48 h whilst control mortality remains at an accepted level, i.e.< 10 %, it is appropriate to extend the duration of the test to a maximum of 96 h.

The Daphnia are exposed to the test substance added to water at a range of concentrations for 48 hours.If a shorter test is used, justification should be given in the test report.Under otherwise identical test conditions, and an adequate range of test substance concentrations, different concentrations of a test substance exert different average degrees of effect on the swimming ability of Daphnia. Different concentrations result in different percentages of Daphnia being no longer capable of swimming at the end of the test.

                "definition": "In the preparation of this updated method special attention was given to possible improvements in relation to animal welfare concerns and to the evaluation of all existing information on the test substance in order to avoid unnecessary testing in laboratory animals. This method includes the recommendation that prior to undertaking the described in vivo test for corrosion/irritation of the substance, a weight-of-the-evidence analysis be performed on the existing relevant data. Where insufficient data are available, they can be developed through application of sequential testing. The testing strategy includes the performance of validated and accepted in vitro tests and is provided as an Annex to this method. In addition, where appropriate, the successive, instead of simultaneous, application of the three test patches to the animal in the initial in vivo test is recommended.In the interest of both sound science and animal welfare, in vivo testing should not be undertaken until all available data relevant to the potential dermal corrosivity/irritation of the substance have been evaluated in a weight-of-the-evidence analysis. Such data will include evidence from existing studies in humans and/or laboratory animals, evidence of corrosivity/irritation of one or more structurally related substances or mixtures of such substances, data demonstrating strong acidity or alkalinity of the substance, and results from validated and accepted in vitro or ex vivo tests. This analysis should decrease the need for in vivo testing for dermal corrosivity/irritation of substances for which sufficient evidence already exists from other studies as to those two endpoints.A preferred sequential testing strategy, which includes the performance of validated and accepted in vitro or ex vivo tests for corrosion/irritation, is included as an Annex to this Method. The strategy was developed at, and unanimously recommended by the participants of, an OECD workshop, and has been adopted as the recommended testing strategy in the Globally Harmonised System for the Classification of Chemical Substances (GHS). It is recommended that this testing strategy be followed prior to undertaking in vivo testing. For new substances it is the recommended stepwise testing approach for developing scientifically sound data on the corrosivity/irritation of the substance. For existing substances with insufficient data on dermal corrosion/irritation, the strategy should be used to fill missing data gaps.",

The degree of eye irritation/corrosion is evaluated by scoring lesions of conjunctiva, cornea, and iris, at specific intervals. Other effects in the eye and adverse systemic effects are also described to provide a complete evaluation of the effects. The duration of the study should be sufficient to evaluate the reversibility or irreversibility of the effects.Animals showing continuing signs of severe distress and/or pain at any stage of the test should be humanely killed, and the substance assessed accordingly.

It is desirable to have, as far as possible, information on the water solubility , vapour pressure, chemical stability, dissociation constants and biodegradability of the substance to help in the selection of the most appropriate test method (static, semi-static or flow-through) for ensuring satisfactorily constant concentrations of the test substance over the period of the test.Additional information (for instance structural formula, degree of purity, nature and percentage of significant impurities, presence and amounts of additives, and n-octanol/water partition coefficient) should be taken into consideration in both the planning of the test and interpretation of the results.Acute fish toxicity is expressed as the median lethal concentration (LC50), that is the concentration in water which kills 50% of a test batch of fish within a continuous period of exposure which must be stated.All concentrations of the test substance are given in weight by volume (milligrams per liter). They may also be expressed as weight by weight (mg.kg-l).A limit test may be performed at 100 mg per liter in order to demonstrate that the LC50 is greater than this concentration.The fish are exposed to the test substance added to water at a range of concentrations for a period of 96 hours. Mortalities are recorded at least at 24-hour intervals, and the concentrations killing 50% of the fish (LC50) at each observation time are calculated where possible.",

In 1984, a new approach to acute toxicity testing was suggested by the British Toxicology Society based on the administration at a series of fixed dose levels. The approach avoided using death of animals as an endpoint, and relied instead on the observation of clear signs of toxicity at one of a series of fixed dose levels. Following UK and international in vivo validation studies the procedure was adopted as a testing method in 1992. Subsequently, the statistical properties of the Fixed Dose Procedure have been evaluated using mathematical models in a series of studies. Together, the in vivo and modelling studies have demonstrated that the procedure is reproducible, uses fewer animals and causes less suffering than the traditional methods and is able to rank substances in a similar manner to the other acute toxicity testing methods.",

Avalue of 100 is normally used by bodies such as the Joint FAO/WHO Committee onFood Additives and Contaminants (JECFA) and the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting onPesticide Residues (JMPR) to derive an acceptable daily intake (ADI), atolerable daily intake (TDI) or a reference dose (RfD) for the generalpopulation based on a NOAEL or LOAEL from a chronic study in animals. Theapproach under which CSAFs would be used in risk assessment has been such thatin the absence of data, the usual default uncertainty factor would be used.This does not necessarily mean that the default of 100 is the ideal value; itis simply recognition that this reflects the common current approach toderiving a health-based guidance value for the general population.",

Ecological risk assessment provides risk managers with a tool for considering available scientific information when selecting a course of action, in addition to other factors that may affect their decision (e.g., social, legal, political, or economic). Ecological risk assessment includes three phases (problem formulation, analysis, and risk characterization). Within problem formulation, important areas include identifying goals and assessment endpoints, preparing a conceptual model, and developing an analysis plan. The analysis phase involves evaluating exposure to stressors and the relationship between stressor levels and ecological effects. In risk characterization, key elements are estimating risk through integration of exposure and stressor-response profiles, describing risk by discussing lines of evidence and determining ecological adversity, and preparing a report.",

The route a substance takes from its source (where it began) to its end point (where it ends), and how people can come into contact with (or get exposed to) it. An exposure pathway has five parts: a source of contamination (such as an abandoned business); an environmental media and transport mechanism (such as movement through groundwater); a point of exposure (such as a private well); a route of exposure (eating, drinking, breathing, or touching), and a receptor population (people potentially or actually exposed). When all five parts are present, the exposure pathway is termed a completed exposure pathway. RAGS Volume I, Part A, Chapter 6 defines exposure pathway as \"the course a chemical or physical agent takes from a source to an exposed organism. An exposure pathway describes a unique mechanism by which an individual or population is exposed to chemicals or physical agents at or originating from a site. Each exposure pathway includes a source or release from a source, an exposure point, and an exposure route. If the exposure point differs from the source, a transport/exposure medium (e.g. air) or media (in cases of intermedia transfer) also is included.",

A process designed to determine the possible adverse effects of an agent or situation to which an organism, system or (sub) population could be exposed. The process includes hazard identification and hazard characterization. The process focuses on the hazard in contrast to risk assessment where exposure assessment is a distinct additional step. Process designed to determine factors contributing to the possible adverse effects of a substance to which a human population or an environmental compartment could be exposed. The process includes three steps: hazard identification, hazard characterization, and hazard evaluation .

Dose-response model based on the multistage model of carcinogenesis that is restricted to a form that is approximately linear at low doses. P(d) = 1 - exp(-q0-q1 x d-...qk x d k ), where q1, which is called the linear term, is equal to or greater than zero, d is the average lifetime daily dose of the chemical in mg/kg/day, P(d) is the lifetime probability of cancer from the dose level d, and q0,...,qk are nonnegative parameters estimated by fitting the model to experimental animal carcinogenicity data. The input into this model is the experimental dose, the number of animals with the specific tumor, and the number of animals at risk or examined for that specific tumor. This is often referred to as quantal data. The quantity of principal interest is not the absolute probability of a cancer P(d), but rather the extra lifetime risk of cancer resulting from exposure to dose d. This risk is defined as [P(d)-P(0)]/[1-P(0)], and can be interpreted as the probability of the occurrence of a tumor at a dose of d, given that no tumor would have occurred in the absence of the dose.",

It is defined as the promotion of health by the individual and the community, and includes identifying departures from good health and intervening to correct them or to minimize their effects.  •          Primary poisons prevention  activities intervene before the event, aiming to prevent it happening, either by controlling the victim’s access to the agent, controlling the action of an agent upon the victim, or controlling or changing hostile environmental factors. Primary prevention strategies may beactive or passive. •          Active strategies  seek to change attitudes, lifestyles and behaviours of individuals and groups, for example, by educating communities and individuals about poison awareness and safety practices, or campaigning for initiatives such as safer packaging, labelling and storage of chemical products. •          Passive strategies  automatically protect people, by improving the safety of products and the environment where they are used. Once these changes are made, they require little individual effort from the beneficiary and can have a far-reaching impact. •          Secondary poisons prevention  is the action taken after an exposure has occurred, to prevent the poisoning from progressing to a more serious, irreversible or chronic stage and to restore the victim to his/her former state of health. It includes the initial steps to minimize the effects of the toxic agent, the diagnosis, decontamination and first aid treatment, and specific antidote therapy. This may include educating both the community and professionals about how to recognize and manage poisonings and how to give first aid after a toxic exposure by, for example, washing the skin and eyes immediately after contamination by a pesticide. Tertiary poisons prevention deals with the diagnosis and treatment of poisoning victims who cannot be treated to full recovery, to prevent death or permanent disability. It is also concerned with educating victims and their relatives about how to make the most of the remaining potential for healthy living, including the avoidance of unnecessary hardships, restrictions and complications, i.e., rehabilitation and physiotherapy in cases of toxic polyneuropathy.",

Also see cohort study. Prospective studies, also called cohort studies, select subjects based on their exposure status, and subjects are generally healthy at the beginning of the study. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later disease or outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be watching a group of smokers versus nonsmokers through time and measuring incidence of eventual lung cancer. The same 2x2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the statistic generated is the Relative Risk (RR), which is the incidence of disease in the exposured group (A/A+B) over the incidence in the unexposed (C/C+D). As with the OR, a RR greater than 1 shows association, where the conclusion can be read \"those with the exposure were more likely to develop disease.\" Prospective studies have many benefits over case control studies. The RR is a more powerful statistic than the OR, as the OR is just an estimation of the RR, since true incidence cannot be calculated in a case control study where subjects are selected based on disease status. Temporality can be established in a prospective study, and confounders are more easily controlled for. However, they are more costly, and there is a greater chance of losing subjects to follow-up based on the long time period over which the cohort is followed.",

Structure–activity relationships (SARs) are models based on structural features, and quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSARs) rely on quantitative (frequently physicochemical) properties. The most general mathematical form of a (Q)SAR is Activity = f ( physicochemical properties and/or structural features). The training compounds are stored in databases together with their activity values. Formally, we have observed data for n cases ([x1, y1], ... , [xn, yn]), where each xi = (xi1, …, xim) is a feature vector of m input values and each yi is the associated activity (dependent variable). The observations and corresponding activities can therefore be compactly represented in a data matrix, X (sometimes also referred to as set X), and a corresponding activity vector y. Our primary interest is to predict the unknown activity value yq for a query compound xq. A predicted value for xq is commonly referred to as f(xq), associated with a confidence value, c, which is derived from certain properties of the model that describe the goodness of the fit.
